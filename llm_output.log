The command you are referring to is the `is_x` property in Yosys, which can be found in the Property Index section of the Yosys documentation. This command sets a cell's property "is_" to either true or false, and the `x-` suffix means that it is a default property for all cells (unless overridden).

Regarding Avy, it seems to be a project related to Yosys and can be found at the provided URL: https://arieg.bitbucket.io/avy/. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide more specific information about it. For detailed information, I would recommend visiting the official Avy documentation or reaching out to its developers directly.
